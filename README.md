# **Create-Receipt-of-Credit-Hours**

This is the final project for COP3330, Object Oriented Programming.

# Overview:
 A user will be asked to make a selection from a list of 7 options...  
 1- Enter the information of a faculty  
 2- Enter the information of a student  
 3- Print tuition invoice for a student  
 4- Print faculty information  
 5- Enter the information of a staff member  
 6- Print the information of a staff member  
 7- Exit Program  

 The user will keep adding/printing faculty members, staff members, and students until they choose to exit the program. They will then be asked if they want to print an invoice. If they choose to do so, the results will be outputed in a text file called _"report.txt"_ (can be found in project2 or src folders).
